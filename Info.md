# AutoUpdatePublicIPAddressSignumNode
- If your IP address is not static, that's it, problem fixed, now the Signum Node will keep working 24/7 .
- The 2 purposes of the AutoHotKey script is to run the PowerShell script and show an icon in the icon tray, so you know the script is running, but this is not necessary, if you want you can modify the PowerShell script and put a 60 seconds loop and that's it.
- The ".exe" file is just the ".ahk" file compiled, it shows a pretty icon in the icon tray bar instead of the standard logo of AutoHotkey.
- The ".ps1" file is what contains the actual script.
