# AutoUpdatePublicIPAddressSignumNode
- If your IP address is not static, that's it, problem fixed, now the Signum Node will keep working 24/7 .
- The 2 purposes of the AutoHotKey script are to run the PowerShell script and show an icon in the icon tray, so you know the script is running, but this is not necessary, if you want you can modify the PowerShell script and put a 60 seconds loop and that's it.
- The ".exe" file is just the ".ahk" file compiled, it shows a pretty icon in the icon tray bar instead of the standard logo of AutoHotkey.
- If you want to use the ".ahk" you have to install "Chocolatey", but if you use the ".exe" you don't have to.
- It's not necessary to run this script with Admin Privileges, but if you are running the Signum Node with Admin Privileges it is, otherwise the script won't be able to stop and start the Signum Node.
- Any suggestion is always appreciated.
